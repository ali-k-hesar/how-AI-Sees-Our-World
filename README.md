Vision Transformer (ViT) models, with their attention mechanisms, revolutionized computer vision. By merging Class Activation Map (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) concepts with ViT's attention maps, we gain deeper insights into how these models perceive and analyze images.
